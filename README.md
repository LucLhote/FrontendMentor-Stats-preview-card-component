## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project allowed me to work with Grid. I've never built anything using it except in tutorials.

I took note of the ```mix-blend-mode``` CSS property which allowed me to achieve the same result as the design. Without this property, I wouldn't be able to have a visual similar to the original idea.

### Useful resources

- [mix-blend-mode - CSS: Cascading Style Sheets | MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/mix-blend-mode) - This ressource helped me to understand how to blend elements and then come up with something similar to the original design idea.
